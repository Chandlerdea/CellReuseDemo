# cell-reuse-demo
This is a example of an easier way to format table and collection view cells

This project is just a fun idea I had for making cell reuse and formatting easier. There are many ways to go about this, and I have expanded on this idea in my personal projects. This is just the basic idea of the technique I use. If you have any ideas, or ways to make this better, make a PR! I would love to see your ideas.
